Barebones notes app


idk how to organize the folders yet


node 16
mariadb 10.6


to set up:
```
npm install
```


To run:
```
npm run start

You can also run the server with the "Server" launch process in vscode, for debugging.

I installed mariadb and mysql workbench
in mysql workbench:
```
SHOW DATABASES
CREATE DATABASE stoats
